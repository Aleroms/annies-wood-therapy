## post mortem

I started this project by considering how I can optimize dev time and keep my code dry. I chose to complete `HTML` for all routes and then continue adding `CSS` after.

## installation instructions

sass preprocessor `npm install -D sass`
font awesome:
`npm install @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core`
`npm i --save @fortawesome/vue-fontawesome@latest-3`
`npm i --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`
